# ShinigamiVision

## Using OpenCV for face recognition and video manipulation.

## :grey_question: What is it?
I wanted to learn some OpenCV. I had this idea of the "Shinigami Eyes" from Deathnote (look that up).
Using some face / eye cascades, I got this final product. The code sure isn't pretty, but I learned a lot about CV and some other things.

## :zap: Features:
* Finds a face!
* Finds eyes!
* Applies filters on frame, depending on if face / eyes found!
* Music!
* Animation! (okay maybe that's much)
* Moving text!

## :package: Modules / Packages:
* numpy: https://numpy.org/devdocs/contents.html
* pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html
* os: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
* pygame:https://www.pygame.org/news
* cv2: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
* random: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

###### :hammer: To do:
Again likely done with this. However, I intend to look more into object / position tracking with CV. Learned a lot about how CV works through this guy, but really a scratch on the surface.
